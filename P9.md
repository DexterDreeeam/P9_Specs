### Modules in P9
* [Sdk](https://github.com/DexterDreeeam/P9/tree/main/Sdk)  
    An OS level abstract layer which is all others basic Sdk/Software-Development-Kit.
    `Sdk` supports cross OS, provides all OS object and standard algo container. All other module should on `Sdk` as basic library. Using OS header or standard library in other library should be intolerable.
    `Sdk` include nearly all std container, OS objects like event and thread, reference object, json formatter and even standard exception structure.
* [Gpx](https://github.com/DexterDreeeam/P9/tree/main/Gpx)  
    Graphics interface, enhanced for game development. Vulkan is the only interface `Gpx` supported. `Gpx` depends on `Sdk`.
* [Ge](https://github.com/DexterDreeeam/P9/tree/main/Ge)  
    `Ge` is short for P9 Game Engine, which is designed for game developer. `Ge` depends on `Gpx`.
